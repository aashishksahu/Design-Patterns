    ">The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I understood**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to create a piece of software that adds new requirements, then you want to be able to maintain it in such a way that adding new algorithms and functionality doesn't break down the existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategy pattern in layman terms is plug-n-play. Instead of hard binding a set of functionality in a base class and override it in the derived class we can create a generic interface or class that describes the behaiviour or strategy to implement that algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, If I am making robots for the government, I will use a base class to describe what I am building, i.e., `Robot`. Now, there can be different kinds of robots, such as, navy robots, flight robots for air force, stealth robots for intelligence agencies, clerk robots for reception etc. A navy robot and a stealth robot both will use guns, but a navy robot might use a rifle while a stealth robot uses a handgun with supressor. A clerk robot will not use guns at all. Therefore, we need to have multiple implementations of `gunUseStrategy` to suit the needs of a specific robot. "
